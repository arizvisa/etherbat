Etherbat - Ethernet topology discovery

  What is Etherbat?

   Etherbat performs Ethernet topology discovery between 3 hosts: the machine
   running Etherbat and two other devices.

     * Are they in the same switch?
     * Are they in three separate switches?
     * Which host is closer to local machine?

       - these are example questions answered by Etherbat.

   Etherbat could be described as layer 2 equivalent of traceroute.

   No manageable switches nor extra software on remote hosts is required.

  Use cases

    Locating hosts

   Attacker: "Where is that internal database server located?"

   Admin: "I know there is an internal attack executing right now, but where
   it originates from?"

    Network mapping

   Admin: "I want to have detailed map of the network, but I don't want to
   track every cable physically. The boss doesn't want to buy manageable
   switches."

   Auditor: "Let's check if the network documentation describes real network
   structure."

   Note: The map of the network could be created by repeatedly executing
   Etherbat with different host combinations and joining gathered results.
   Etherbat won't do this automatically.

  Features

     * Ethernet topology discovery between 3 hosts
     * 8 different topologies recognized
     * No manageable switches required:
          * reduces costs for network owner,
          * no need to get access to them for an attacker.
     * No extra software on remote hosts is neccessary.
     * Error detection and correction decreases probability of false result.
     * Different switch types supported.
     * Mostly clean and (I hope) easy to read OO Ruby code, GPL.

  Limitations

   Warning! Etherbat was tested only on wired network. It won't work on
   wireless. Also, it could give incorrect results:

     * on networks with hubs and/or some (broken) switch types and software
       bridges (i.e. Linux bridge used by many wireless Access Points)
     * on some enterprise switches due to delayed MAC learning process (may
       be fixed in future versions by increasing timeouts)
     * when hosts being tested are generating traffic during test and it's
       not detected by Etherbat
     * in some situations if Windows machines are being tested (in these
       cases Etherbat displays warning message)
     * probably in other cases due to not yet discovered bugs

  How does it work?

   Etherbat uses MAC spoofing to create invalid paths in the network, probes
   how it changed by injecting specially crafted ARP requests and checks for
   replies or absence of them. Afterwards it makes the network return to
   normal state.

   For more detailed explanation please read the documentation.

  Requirements

     * Ruby (1.8.4 tested)
     * Libnet (1.1.2.1 tested)
     * Libpcap 0.9.3 or higher. Previous versions will not work as
       pcap_setdirection() function is needed (as far as I know this function
       is implemented only on Linux and *BSD)
     * Glib 2.0 (2.12.4 tested)
     * Libnet, Libpcap and Glib headers and c toolchain for compilation

   Etherbat is written in interpreted language, but needs to launch external
   processes for frame injection and sniffing. Those are C programs which
   needs to be compiled.

  Download

   Etherbat releases can be downloaded from Launchpad project page.

   There is also the Bazaar repository. To get the latest version of Etherbat
   type:

    $ bzr branch http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~launchpad-cryptonix/etherbat/trunk

   Etherbat source code is released under the terms of GPLv2 license.

  Compilation and installation

   You are advised to check Etherbat tarball integrity against my gpg key,
   which can be downloaded from here. If the tarball and signature are in the
   current working directory, issue:

    $ gpg --verify etherbat-*.tar.gz.asc

   After positive verification, you can extract Etherbat source distribution
   with:

    $ tar zxf etherbat-*.tar.gz

   Then enter newly created directory and optionally alter instalation path
   at the beginning of Makefile. If you want to link Libnet and Libpcap
   libraries to be linked dynamically (you should do this if your
   distribution ships shared versions of these libraries like Debian does)
   execute:

    $ make

   Otherwise, you need to specify libpcap.a and/or libnet.a files to link
   statically with. For example if both are places in /usr/lib/ you should
   type:

    $ make PCAP_STATIC=/usr/lib/libpcap.a LIBNET_STATIC=/usr/lib/libnet.a

   After successful compilation, if you are using sudo issue:

    $ sudo make install

   or if you are using su:

    $ su -c "make install"

   Note that the installation is required for program to run correctly. You
   can uninstall it with:

    $ sudo make uninstall

   or if you are using su:

    $ su -c "make uninstall"

  Usage

   Etherbat requires two IP addresses as arguments. It will display how local
   machine and hosts with those addresses are connected in form of ASCII
   diagram. Here is example output (for those of you typing ^fscreenshot in
   Firefox ;-) )

 # etherbat 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2

   options read tests description.

  Documentation 

   I gave a talk on Etherbat on Confidence 2007 - you will find the
   presentation in the papers section of my website.

   Also there is tests documentation with every step explained in details
   (tests.* in tarball).

   I've planned to write whitepaper about Ethernet topology discovery, but
   some time after I had finished Etherbat 1.0.0 I've found this document. It
   describes similiar technique invented by three Microsoft guys (Richard
   Black, Austin Donnelly and Cedric Fournet) and presented in 2004 on IEEE
   conference. Reading it will give you almost everything needed to
   understand how Etherbat works.

   Recently I've found this technique was implemented in Windows Vista as
   Link Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD) and used in Network Map feature.

   When I was writing Etherbat I was unaware of Microsoft researchers work.
   General idea of LLTD and the technique used by Etherbat is the same, but
   there are some differences.

   The main difference is that LLTD is far more complex (as it's distibuted
   system) and has more features, ie. it provides extensions for QoS tests,
   integrates anti-DoS functions. And last but not least - every host being
   located could provide his own icon to appear on the map (I wonder when
   LLTD themes will show on the Internet ;-)

  TODO 

     * HIGH PRIORITY: Three remote hosts mode. It is more resistant to
       different switch types and better handles Windows machines.
     * One host mode - fingerprint path from local host to remote machine
       (taking advantage of different switch types behavior and some other
       tricks).
     * Support for other asymetric protocols and techniques, i.e. IPv6 (NDP
       in place of ARP), IPX, ARP+L3/4 (no need for asymetric ARP - poison
       ARP cache, send spoofed ping and wait for reply; can be used with TCP
       or UDP).
     * Are all recognized topologies correct? In particular direct
       connections on ASCII diagrams may not be direct in case of some switch
       types.
     * Batch mode to test many host combinations in one invocation (for use
       by third party mapping apps).
     * Increase performance under high pps (optimize frame handling, use bpf
       filters to ignore irrelevant frames).
     * Optimize tests to generate less traffic.

  FAQ

    1. Can I use Etherbat to map remote network which is somewhere in the
       Internet?

       Etherbat is a layer 2 tool, uses MAC spoofing and ARP protocol. This
       kind of stuff won't be forwarded by routers.
       The only possibility is too use some kind of Ethernet over IP
       tunneling (note: when the tunnel is not 100% transparent it may impact
       result).

    2. What is there are hubs (Ethernet repeaters) in the network?

       Depending on hub placement Etherbat will work good, refuse to work or
       work badly and display incorrect results.

    3. Etherbat doesn't display all switches.

       If there are multiple switches in the line between hosts under test
       they are displayed as 0, 1 or more switches. See symbols description
       at the end of tests description.
